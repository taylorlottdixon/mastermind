# Theme - Cupcakes
    There are 8 different cupcakes and five plates, which act as the available guessing spots
    On opening the game, the cupcakes will randomize onto the plates at regular intervals (just aesthetic)
    Rules will be shown here, then be accessible through a pop up window in the corner

    Game board initiates
    random code of colors/images generated secretly

# Player Turn

# Check guesses
    Check if each item is in the code array and/or in the correct index
        If item is in the array AND in the correct index, circle in green
        Else if item is included in the array (not the correct index), circle in yellow
        Else (nowhere in array), circle in red
    Check if all items are correct
        If all items are green (correct items in proper index), display winner message
        Else (any item is not green), add a new guess row (empty array) and prompt for user input again

            Then the prompt appears to guess the cupcakes
