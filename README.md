# Cupcake Master
 Cupcake Master is a mastermind style game using 8 possible cupcakes to create a secret code of 5 total.

 This game was initially created as a project in my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Tasked with creating a Mastermind game, I decided to get a little whimsical with it! I hope you enjoy some hard won cupcakes!
